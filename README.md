# studentSearch
This was the course on JavaScript Loops, Arrays and Objects on Treehouse. This particular program has an array of student objects that have properties such as name, the track they're following, and points earned. The way the program should work is that you should be able to search for a student name and the program should return their properties and values. 

Fixed a bug that was causing the student data not to show until you quit the program. This was due to the Google fonts link I used to render the Lato Font Family. After removing this, the code worked fine, but only in Chrome and Firefox. Unfortunately, it still doesn't work quite properly in Safari.

Student names are: Mijelor, Vero, Nate, Capelito, Kathrin.

Best,

Nathaniel
