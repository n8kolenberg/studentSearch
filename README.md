# studentSearch
This was the course on JavaScript Loops, Arrays and Objects on Treehouse. This particular program has an array of student objects that have properties such as name, the track they're following, and points earned. The way the program should work is that you should be able to search for a student name and the program should return their properties and values. 

Unfortunately, at present, it doesn't show you the student details until you enter quit in the prompt. I'm working on a fix for this bug currently. Will update this readme file once done.

Best,

Nathaniel
